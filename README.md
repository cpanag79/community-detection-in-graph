Community Detection in Graph Using Synthetic Coordinates

Matlab Code: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46360-community-detection-in-graph

This is an implementation of Community Detection Using Synthetic Coordinates
and the synthetic datasets used in [1].

You can use them only for non-commercial purposes.
If you use them, please cite [1]. The code of .java files
is written by H. Papadakis.

runSSCD.m: function that calls the SCCD.jar.
testSCCD.m: script that tests runSSCD
USAGE: [COMM,L] = runSSCD('pareto-graph_1000_5_30_0.75.txt')
where pareto-graph_1000_5_30_0.75.txt is the graph file that represents the graph edges.
See comments on .m files for more details.

output file: coms.txt: Each line holds the ids of all nodes of a community separated by space

In this work, we propose an algorithm that Ô¨Ånds the
entire community structure of a network, based on local interactions between
neighboring nodes and on an unsupervised distributed hierarchical clustering
algorithm. The novelty of the proposed approach, named SCCD (to stand for
Synthetic Coordinate Community Detection), is the fact that the algorithm is based on the use of Vivaldi synthetic network coordinates computed by a distributed algorithm.
